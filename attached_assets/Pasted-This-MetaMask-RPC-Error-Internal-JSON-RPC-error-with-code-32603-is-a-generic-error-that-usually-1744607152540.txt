This MetaMask - RPC Error: Internal JSON-RPC error with code: -32603 is a generic error that usually means something went wrong during the transaction execution on the node or smart contract level. Based on your logs, a few key points stand out:

🔍 Main Error Insight

Error: execution reverted: "Election does not exist"
This message clearly comes from your smart contract, and it's the actual cause of the issue. This means you're trying to vote in an election (election ID: 1744606200) that has not been created or initialized in the smart contract.

Even though the client seems to think the candidate exists and can proceed, the smart contract function likely includes a check like this:

solidity
Copy
Edit
require(electionExists[electionId], "Election does not exist");
So when that check fails, the function reverts — and MetaMask throws the internal error.

✅ What’s Working
Your frontend is:

Checking candidate existence

Verifying votes

Preparing a valid transaction

MetaMask is properly estimating gas and signing the transaction

🚫 What’s Failing
The smart contract’s vote() function is rejecting the transaction due to a non-existent election ID.

Error gets returned by the node → relayed to MetaMask → shown as Internal JSON-RPC error.

🛠️ Steps to Fix
Confirm Election ID Exists
In your smart contract code or deployment script:

Check if election 1744606200 was successfully created and added to the mapping or list (e.g., mapping(uint => Election)).

Use a method like getElection(uint id) or electionExists[id] to verify existence.

Check for ID Type Mismatch

Is 1744606200 a timestamp or hash being used as ID?

Are you passing it as a uint while expecting a bytes32 or something else in the contract?

Check for any type mismatch that might make the ID "look" valid in frontend but fail in the contract.

Review Contract Logs

If you're using tools like Hardhat, Ganache, or Remix, check the logs for whether the election was created.

Was it created using the same account or network you're using now?

Improve Frontend Error Handling

Catch and parse revert reasons from the error object:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (error?.data?.message?.includes("Election does not exist")) {
    alert("You're trying to vote in an election that doesn't exist. Please create it first.");
}
This avoids users seeing the vague Internal JSON-RPC error.
