 SQL Injection Vulnerability

    Issue:

        Attackers may use SQL injection techniques (e.g., inserting malicious SQL commands like a single quote ') to try and expose the database structure and sensitive information.

    Solution:

        Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to interact with the database.

        Sanitize all inputs to prevent malicious data from reaching the database.

6. File Inclusion/Path Traversal Attacks

    Issue:

        Attackers may manipulate file paths to gain access to restricted files or system directories, exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities.

    Solution:

        Implement proper input validation to ensure that file paths cannot be tampered with.

        Avoid directly including files based on user input and instead sanitize or validate file names and paths.

7. Form Manipulation

    Issue:

        Attackers might manipulate form fields or hidden parameters to gather backend logic or sensitive user data, such as altering hidden form fields to see how the app reacts.

    Solution:

        Ensure that form data is validated server-side and that sensitive fields are properly protected.

        Implement anti-CSRF tokens in forms to prevent unauthorized manipulations.

8. Application Fuzzing

    Issue:

        Attackers may use tools like Burp Suite Intruder to send various unexpected inputs to the application, probing for weak points that result in informative errors.

    Solution:

        Perform fuzz testing to identify weak points and unhandled exceptions in your application.

        Handle unexpected inputs gracefully, and log only necessary information to avoid exposing sensitive data in error logs.

Vulnerability: User Enumeration in Forgot Password Feature

    Issue:

        The Forgot Password feature can be exploited for user enumeration if different error messages are returned for valid and invalid emails.

    Steps to Reproduce:

        Go to the Forgot Password page.

        Submit a random email.

        Intercept the request using Burp Suite.

        The response might reveal errors like {"err": "No account with that id found."}, which exposes valid email addresses.

    Solution:

        Use a generic response for both valid and invalid emails:

            “If the email exists in our system, we will send a password reset link.”

        This prevents attackers from determining if an email is registered or not.
