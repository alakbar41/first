    Password Reset - Invalid Email Handling

        Issue: When an incorrect email is entered, it says "User not found" but still displays the 6-digit OTP form.

        Fix: The OTP form should only be shown when a valid email is entered.

    Password Reset - OTP Verification Fails

        Issue: A valid OTP is sent to the user's email, but when entered, it says "Invalid OTP."

        Fix: Ensure that OTP validation correctly matches the one stored in the system.

    Admin Login Redirect

        Issue: After logging in as an admin, the system displays an unnecessary placeholder page.

        Fix: Directly redirect the admin to the Admin Dashboard.

    Faculty Consistency in Elections & Candidates

        Issue: When students register, they select a faculty, but these options are not consistent in other parts of the system.

        Fix: Faculty options should be SITE, SPA, SB, SESD across:

            Student registration

            Eligibility selection in Senator elections

            Faculty selection when adding a candidate

    Candidate Must Have a Student ID

        Issue: Currently, candidates can be created without a Student ID.

        Fix: Student ID should be a required field when adding a candidate.

    President/Vice President Election Candidate Selection

        Issue: The first option is always labeled as "Select President," but when "Vice President" is chosen first, the next selection changes incorrectly.

        Fix: The first selection should always be President, and the second should always be Vice President.

        Also, when viewing candidates, replace "Running Mate" with "President" and "Vice President".

    Candidate Deletion When in an Election

        Issue: Sometimes, the system prevents deleting candidates who are in an election, but other times it does not.

        Fix: Ensure that a candidate cannot be deleted without being removed from the election first.

    Candidate ID Resets After Deletion

        Issue: When candidates are deleted, their IDs should reset and start from 1 again.

        Fix: Ensure that candidate IDs are updated sequentially after deletions.

    Election Editing Fails

        Issue: When trying to edit an election, an error appears:

            "JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data"

        Fix: Check for JSON formatting errors and ensure data is correctly structured before saving.

    Candidate Status Remains Active After Election is Deleted

    Issue: If an election is deleted, candidates who were part of that election still show Active status, and the system prevents deleting them.

    Fix: When an election is deleted, all associated candidates should have their status updated correctly.
