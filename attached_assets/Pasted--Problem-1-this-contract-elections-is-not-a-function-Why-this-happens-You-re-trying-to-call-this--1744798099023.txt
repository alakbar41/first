✅ Problem 1: this.contract.elections is not a function
Why this happens:
You're trying to call this.contract.elections(startTime) in your frontend, but elections is a public mapping, not a function in the ABI.

➡️ In Solidity, a public mapping like:

solidity
Copy
Edit
mapping(uint256 => Election) public elections;
...automatically generates a getter. However, the getter returns a struct, and ABI doesn't expose getters for structs (only for basic types or arrays).

✅ Fix:
If you want to fetch election details (start, end, status, etc.), add an explicit getter like this:

solidity
Copy
Edit
function getElectionDetails(uint256 startTime) external view returns (
    uint256,
    uint256,
    ElectionStatus,
    bool,
    uint256
) {
    Election storage election = elections[startTime];
    return (
        election.startTime,
        election.endTime,
        election.status,
        election.resultsFinalized,
        election.totalVotesCast
    );
}
✅ Problem 2: autoUpdateElectionStatus is not a function
Your frontend is calling this.contract.autoUpdateElectionStatus(), but there’s no such function in your smart contract.

✅ Fix Options:

Either add such a function:

solidity
Copy
Edit
function autoUpdateElectionStatus(uint256 startTime) external {
    updateElectionStatus(startTime);
}
Or update the frontend to just call updateElectionStatus(startTime) directly.

✅ Problem 3: no matching fragment for updateElectionStatus(1, 1)
This error suggests you are calling updateElectionStatus with two arguments, but your ABI defines it with only one:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "inputs": [{ "internalType": "uint256", "name": "startTime", "type": "uint256" }],
  "name": "updateElectionStatus",
  ...
}
✅ Fix: Update your frontend call to:

ts
Copy
Edit
await contract.updateElectionStatus(startTime); // Only 1 parameter
✅ Quick Summary of Actions You Need:
Add getElectionDetails in the contract if you want structured data on the election.

Fix frontend logic to not treat elections mapping like a function.

Add autoUpdateElectionStatus() function if it’s being called.

Pass correct arguments to updateElectionStatus (just startTime).
